## What?

`IttyBittyTable` is a small but powerful `R` package to draw HTML, LaTeX, PDF, Markdown, and Typst tables. The interface is minimalist, but it gives users direct and convenient access to powerful frameworks to create endlessly customizable tables: 

* `tabularray` for LaTeX and PDF 
* Bootstrap for HTML.

## Why?

```{r, include=FALSE}
db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
dep_ke <- tools::package_dependencies(c("kableExtra"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_hux <- tools::package_dependencies(c("huxtable"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_dt <- tools::package_dependencies(c("DT"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_gt <- tools::package_dependencies(c("gt"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
```
The design philosophy of this package rests on three pillars.

1. _Data is separate from style_. 

The code that this package creates keeps the content of a table separate from the style sheet that applies to its cells. This is in contrast to other `R` packages that modify the actual text in each cell to style it. Keeping data and style separate allows `tidytable` to create human-readable files which are easy to edit, debug, and extend. It also enables developers to keep a tidy code base, with minimal use of messy regular expressions.

2. _Flexibility!_ 

Users' needs are extremely varied, and a table-drawing package must be flexible enough to accomodate different ideas. To achieve this, `IttyBittyTable` builds on battle-tested and versatile frameworks like `Bootstrap` (HTML) and `tabularray` (LaTeX).

3. [_Lightweight is the right weight._](https://www.tinyverse.org/) 

Some of the most popular table-drawing packages in the `R` ecosystem are heavy. For instance, `kableExtra` imports `r dep_ke` `R` dependencies, `gt` `r dep_gt`, `DT` `r dep_dt`, and `huxtable` `r dep_hux`. In contrast, `IttyBittyTable` imports zero 3rd party `R`  package by default.

`IttyBittyTable` is not only lightweight in terms of dependencies, it is also "small" along several other dimensions:

* The user interface is simple, streamlined, consistent, uncluttered.
* The `IttyBittyTable` code base is very small and easy to maintain.
* `IttyBittyTable` is a very thin wrapper around incredibly powerful frameworks: Bootstrap for HTML and `tabularray` for LaTeX.
* This package is free. Tiny tables for a tiny price!
