## What?

`tinytable` is a small but powerful `R` package to draw LaTeX/PDF, HTML, Markdown, and Typst tables. The interface is minimalist, but it gives users direct access to powerful frameworks to create endlessly customizable tables: `tabularray` for LaTeX/PDF and Bootstrap for HTML.

## Why?

```{r, include=FALSE}
db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
dep_ke <- tools::package_dependencies(c("kableExtra"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_hux <- tools::package_dependencies(c("huxtable"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_dt <- tools::package_dependencies(c("DT"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_gt <- tools::package_dependencies(c("gt"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
```
The design philosophy of this package rests on three pillars.

First, _data is separate from style_. The code that `tinytable` creates keeps the data (characters and numbers in a table) separate from the style that should be applied to each cell. This brings important benefits: the files produced by the package are human-readable, which makes them easy to edit and customize. Moreover, keeping data separate from style can be very useful when diagnosing problems.

Second, _tables should be deeply customizable._ Users' needs are incredibly varied, and a table drawing package should be flexible enough to accomodate many ideas. To achieve this, `tinytable` builds on the work of existing frameworks for table creating in HTML and LaTeX formats.

Third, [_lightweight is the right weight._](https://www.tinyverse.org/) Some of the most popular table-drawing packages in the `R` ecosystem are heavy. For instance, `kableExtra` imports `r dep_ke` dependencies, `gt` `r dep_gt`, `huxtable` `r dep_hux`, and `DT` `r dep_dt`. In contrast, `tinytable` imports no other `R`  package by default.

There `tinytable` is also "small" along several other dimensions:

* The user interface is simple, streamlined, consistent, uncluttered.
* The `tinytable` code base is very small and easy to maintain.
* `tinytable` is a very thin wrapper around incredibly powerful frameworks: Bootstrap for HTML and `tabularray` for LaTeX/PDF. By staying "close to the metal", `tinytable` allows users to create endlessly customizable tables:.
* `tinytable` imports no 3rd party `R` package. 
* This package is free. Tiny tables for a tiny price!

## Installation
