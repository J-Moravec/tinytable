## What?

`tinytable` is a small but powerful `R` package to draw LaTeX/PDF, HTML, Markdown, and Typst tables. The interface is minimalist, but it gives users direct access to powerful frameworks to create endlessly customizable tables: `tabularray` for LaTeX/PDF and Bootstrap for HTML.

## Why?

```{r, include=FALSE}
db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
dep_ke <- tools::package_dependencies(c("kableExtra"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
dep_gt <- tools::package_dependencies(c("gt"), recursive=TRUE, db=db)[[1]] |> length()
```
The core design philosophy rests on three pillars:

1. Data is separate from style.
2. Tables should be deeply customizable.
3. [Lightweight is the right weight.](https://www.tinyverse.org/)

There are several senses in which `tinytable` is "light," and this brings many benefits to users and developers: 

* The user interface is simple, streamlined, consistent, uncluttered.
* `tinytable` is a thin wrapper around incredibly powerful frameworks: Bootstrap for HTML and `tabularray` for LaTeX/PDF. By providing quick and easy access to those frameworks, `tinytable` allows users to create endlessly customizable tables:.
* The `tinytable` code base is very small and easy to maintain.
* `tinytable` does not rely on any other `R` package. In contrast, `kableExtra` uses `r dep_ke` dependencies, and `gt` imports `r dep_gt` other packages every time it is loaded.
* This package is free. The price is tiny!

## Installation

You can install the development version of tinytable from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
